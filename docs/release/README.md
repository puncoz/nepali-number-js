| [`versioning.md`](versioning.md) | Is this change a patch, a minor or a major? |
| [`releasing.md`](releasing.md) | What CI runs, how the release workflow publishes, and its current gaps |

Agents never bump the version, tag, or publish ([`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) §3). They
propose a Conventional Commit message whose prefix matches the semver impact; the owner commits
and merges, and the release workflow does the rest.
