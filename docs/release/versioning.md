# Versioning

- **Status:** Current
- **Last updated:** 2026-10-30
- **Related ADRs:** [ADR-0008](../adr/ADR-0008-public-api-changes-ship-their-reference.md)

> Snapshot of the policy as it stands today. Edit in place; never record what changed.

`nepali-number` follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org). The public API is
**every export of the package root, its TypeScript signature, and the string or number it
returns for each input**, plus the published shape (entry points, formats, global name).

## Which bump?

| Change | Bump | Commit prefix |
|---|---|---|
| Remove or rename an export or an option | **major** | `feat!:` |
| Change a parameter, a default, or a return type | **major** | `feat!:` |
| Change the output for an existing input — a word, spelling, spacing, sign, digit, rounding | **major**, unless the next row applies | `feat!:` |
| Fix output that contradicts what `docs/api/` documents | patch | `fix:` |
| Change `exports`, `main`/`module`/`types`, the output formats or the global name | **major** | `feat!:` |
| Drop support for a Node.js version CI tests | **major** | `feat!:` |
| Add an export, an optional option, or an accepted input type | minor | `feat:` |
| Start handling input that previously returned the safe default | minor | `feat:` |
| Export an existing type (`FormatOptions`, …) | minor | `feat:` |
| Faster or smaller, identical output | patch | `perf:` |
| Docs, tests, CI, tooling, internal refactor with identical output | none | `docs:` `test:` `ci:` `chore:` `refactor:` |

A breaking commit carries a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer that says what consumers must change.

## Why output changes are breaking

Applications render these strings and compare them in snapshot tests. Changing
`toNepaliWords(21)` from `"एक्काईस"` to another spelling breaks every snapshot that contains it,
even if the new spelling is better. The exception is output that is wrong *by the package's
own reference*: once `docs/api/` documents a behaviour, code that disagrees with it is a bug.

Entries in [`limitations.md`](../api/limitations.md) are **documented current behaviour**, not
bugs; changing them is a major unless the owner decides otherwise in the ADR.

## Pre-releases

The release workflow listens on `beta` and `alpha` as well as `main`. Pre-release versions
(`2.1.0-beta.1`) publish under the matching dist-tag, so `npm install nepali-number` keeps
installing the latest stable.

## Internal surface

`src/constants.ts` exports (`NEPALI_WORDS`, `NEPALI_SCALES`, …) are **not** re-exported from the
package root. Their shape may change in any release; only what the public functions return is
covered by semver.
