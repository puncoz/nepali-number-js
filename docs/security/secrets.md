# Secrets

The library itself reads **no** secrets, environment variables or configuration. Secrets exist
only in GitHub Actions.

| Secret | Used by | Purpose | Scope / risk if leaked |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CODECOV_TOKEN` | `ci.yml`, `quality` job, Node 24 | Upload `coverage/lcov.info` to Codecov | Can upload coverage reports for this repository; cannot change code or publish |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | `release.yml` | Automatic per-run token; push the release commit and tag, create the GitHub release | `contents: write` on this repository for the duration of the run |

No npm token is configured. When publishing is automated, its ADR adds the credential (or
trusted-publishing setup) to this table in the same change.

## Rules

- **No secret is ever a literal** — not in source, workflows, comments, tests or docs.
- **Secrets are referenced only as `${{ secrets.NAME }}`** and never echoed or written to files
  that are uploaded as artifacts.
- **If a secret is ever committed or printed in a log, rotate it immediately.** Removing it from
  the tree or the history is not enough.
