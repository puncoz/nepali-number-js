## Context

`nepali-number` is a published npm package (2.0.0). Version 2 replaced the v1 API wholesale
(see [`../guides/migration-v1-to-v2.md`](../guides/migration-v1-to-v2.md)), and the owner now
maintains it largely with AI agents.

Two forces make an explicit gate necessary:

- **A published API is expensive to change.** Once a function name, a default or an output
  string ships, consumers depend on it. Renaming it, or changing `"एक्काईस"` to another
  spelling, is a breaking change for every application that renders or compares it. Getting
  the shape right on paper costs minutes; fixing it after release costs a major version.
- **Agents produce plausible work fast.** Without a gate, an API decision — a new option, a
  default, a word form — is made implicitly in code and found by consumers.

## Decision

1. **Every feature and functional change starts with an ADR** in `docs/adr/`, written from
   `docs/_templates/adr.md`, with `Status: Proposed` and an index row in `docs/adr/README.md`.
2. **No library code is written until the owner explicitly approves it.** Approval sets
   `Status: Approved`, `Approved by`, `Approved on`.
3. **Once approved, the whole scope is implemented in one pass**, with tests and every affected
   document, without stopping for per-step review.
4. **Agents never commit, push, tag, rebase, switch branches, bump the version or publish.**
   The owner reviews the working tree and commits; the release workflow publishes.
5. **An approved ADR's Decision is never edited**; it is superseded by a new ADR.
6. **Every ADR states its semver impact** (ADR-0008).

What needs an ADR is the table in `AGENTS.md` §2. Anything that changes an export's output, or
touches Nepali language data, always does.

## Options considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — ADR gate for every functional change | API decisions are explicit, reviewable and recorded before consumers see them | Ceremony on small changes | Chosen |
| B — Code first, document after | Fast | Decisions are implicit; breaking changes are found by consumers | Rejected |
| C — ADRs only for "big" changes | Less ceremony | "Big" is judged by whoever wants to skip it; a one-word spelling change is small and breaking | Rejected |

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Every API decision has a record of why, which an agent in a later session can read.
- The owner controls what reaches npm, change by change.

**Negative / accepted trade-offs**

- Small changes carry an ADR's overhead. Accepted: the template keeps a small ADR small.

**For consumers**

- None directly. Indirectly: fewer accidental breaking changes.

## Package invariants

Establishes the gate through which any departure from `AGENTS.md` §6 must pass.

## Security considerations

None directly — this is a process decision. It does make every dependency, CI and publishing
change pass through the mandatory security section of an ADR (ADR-0005).

## Implementation notes

- [ ] `AGENTS.md` §2–§3 describe the gate and execution rules.
- [ ] `docs/adr/README.md` holds the index and the next free number.
- [ ] `docs/_templates/adr.md` exists.
- Tests: not applicable (process only).

## Docs to update on implementation

- [ ] `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` — already describe this workflow.
- [ ] `docs/adr/README.md` — status on approval.
