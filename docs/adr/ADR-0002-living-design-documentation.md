# ADR-0002 — Documentation is a living snapshot; decisions are immutable

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-10-30
- **Deciders:** Puncoz Nepal
- **Approved by:** —
- **Approved on:** —
- **Supersedes:** —
- **Superseded by:** —
- **Semver impact:** none (process only)
- **Design documents:** `docs/README.md`, every directory `README.md`, `docs/_templates/`

## Context

Before this ADR the package's documentation was a single long `README.md` and an
`AGENTS.md`. Both had drifted from the code, and the drift was the kind consumers hit:

- The README imported `FormatOptions`, `CurrencyOptions` and `NumberSystem` from the package;
  none of them is exported.
- The README's browser example used the global `NepaliNumber`; the build's global is
  `nepaliNumber`.
- The README's currency-words example ended in `"उनासी पैसा"` (79 paisa) for `.89`; the code
  returns `"उनान्नब्बे पैसा"`.
- `AGENTS.md` documented `FormatOptions` defaults as `false` (they are `true` for
  `useNepaliDigits` and `addCommas`), an options argument on `toNepaliCurrencyWords` (it has
  none), title-case output from `toEnglishWords` (it is lower case), and a rule that every
  function calls `normalize()` first (none does).

Documentation that describes a different version is worse than none, because it is believed.

## Decision

1. **Two kinds of document:**
   - `docs/adr/` — **immutable once approved**; superseded, never rewritten.
   - `README.md` and everything else under `docs/` — **living snapshots** of the package as it
     stands, edited in place. No revision tables, no "previously X, now Y", no strikethrough.
     What is no longer true is deleted. Git, ADRs and GitHub release notes hold the history.
     The v1 → v2 migration guide is the one exception: its subject is a difference.
2. **Typed directories**: `api/`, `architecture/`, `guides/`, `release/`, `security/`, each with
   a `README.md` of its conventions, and `_templates/` with a starting point for each. Which
   ones a change requires is the table in `AGENTS.md` §8.
3. **Example outputs are produced by running the built package**, never written from
   expectation.
4. **`README.md` is a summary for npm**: what the package is, install, import in each runtime,
   a short tour and a one-line-per-export table linking to `docs/api/`. The full reference lives
   in `docs/api/`.
5. **Diagrams are Mermaid** in fenced blocks. No binary or externally hosted images.
6. **An implementation is not complete while a document contradicts it.**
7. **Skill-generated specs and plans** go into these directories (usually the ADR and its
   `docs/api/` page), not into a skill's own folder layout.

The design-document types of an application (app flows, ERDs, DFDs, RBAC matrices, sequence
and state diagrams, PRDs) are deliberately absent: a stateless function library has no screens,
storage, actors or roles. A future ADR adds a directory if the package ever needs one.

## Options considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — Living docs in typed directories + immutable ADRs; README as summary | Each document has one job; the current package is always one read away; README stays readable on npm | More files | Chosen |
| B — Everything in README | One place | Already 545 lines and drifted; npm page becomes a reference manual | Rejected |
| C — Generated API docs (TypeDoc) only | Never drifts from signatures | Does not capture outputs, edge cases or limitations; a new dev dependency | Rejected for now |

## Consequences

**Positive**

- A reader finds the current package in `docs/api/`, the reasons in `docs/adr/`.
- Consumers see real outputs, including the surprising ones.

**Negative / accepted trade-offs**

- Example outputs must be re-run when code changes. Accepted: that is the point.

**For consumers**

- Accurate documentation; the README no longer shows imports that fail.

## Package invariants

None directly.

## Security considerations

None directly. `docs/security/` follows the living-snapshot rule, so the threat model and
secrets inventory are kept accurate rather than historical.

## Implementation notes

- [ ] `docs/README.md` and each directory `README.md` exist.
- [ ] `docs/_templates/` holds the templates.
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` §8 states the two kinds and the "write before building" table.
- Tests: not applicable (process only).

## Docs to update on implementation

- [ ] `docs/adr/README.md` — status on approval.
