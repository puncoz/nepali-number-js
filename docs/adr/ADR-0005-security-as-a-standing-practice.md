# ADR-0005 — Supply-chain security is a standing practice

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-10-30
- **Deciders:** Puncoz Nepal
- **Approved by:** —
- **Approved on:** —
- **Supersedes:** —
- **Superseded by:** —
- **Semver impact:** none (process only)
- **Design documents:** `AGENTS.md` §9, `docs/security/README.md`, `threat-model.md`,
  `secrets.md`, `checklist.md`, `docs/_templates/security.md`

## Context

`nepali-number` holds no data, makes no network calls and reads no secrets. It runs inside
other people's applications — servers, browsers, build tools — with their privileges. The ways
it can hurt them are those of any npm package:

- **A compromised release**: a stolen publish credential, or a CI workflow tricked into
  publishing attacker code.
- **A malicious or compromised dependency**: today there are no runtime dependencies, and four
  dev dependencies that run on maintainers' and CI machines.
- **Install-time code execution**: a lifecycle script that runs on every consumer's machine.
- **Denial of service through input**: a regular expression with catastrophic backtracking,
  or unbounded recursion, reachable from user-supplied strings (form fields are a typical
  input to `parseNepaliNumber` and `formatNepaliNumber`).

Security added once, before some release, misses the decisions made along the way.

## Decision

1. **Security is a property of every change.** Every ADR has a mandatory *Security
   considerations* section. "None" is a valid answer; an omitted section is not.
2. **The owner decides** dependency additions, CI token scopes, publishing method and
   provenance, and they are recorded (ADR-0004).
3. **A per-change checklist** (`AGENTS.md` §9) is run for the rows a change touches.
4. **A release audit** (`docs/security/checklist.md`) runs before each release.
5. **Living security documents** in `docs/security/`: threat model, secrets inventory, release
   checklist, and per-change analyses when warranted.
6. **Principles**: zero runtime dependencies (ADR-0009); no lifecycle scripts that run on
   consumers; the tarball contains only `dist/` plus npm's always-included files; no I/O or
   globals in library code; no secret literals anywhere; CI workflows declare least-privilege
   permissions; release runs only after CI passes.

## Options considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — Standing practice, per-change checks, release audit | Decisions are made deliberately when they are cheapest | Overhead on each ADR | Chosen |
| B — Rely on zero dependencies alone | Little overhead | Ignores publishing, CI and ReDoS risk | Rejected |

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Supply-chain decisions are visible and reviewed.

**Negative / accepted trade-offs**

- Every ADR is a little longer. Accepted.

**For consumers**

- A package whose release path and contents are deliberately controlled.

## Package invariants

Directly supports §6.1 (zero runtime dependencies) and §6.2 (environment-agnostic).

## Security considerations

This ADR is the security policy.

## Implementation notes

- [ ] `docs/security/` files exist and describe the current surface.
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` §9 holds the per-change checklist.
- [ ] `docs/_templates/security.md` exists.
- Tests: not applicable (process only).

## Docs to update on implementation

- [ ] `docs/adr/README.md` — status.
