## Context

The package is pure string and number transformation, which makes it cheap to test and costly
to get wrong silently: an off-by-one in grouping, a wrong word for one number out of a hundred,
a float that rounds the wrong way. Its consumers render the output to people.

`bun test` is already the runner (`package.json` `test` script), with coverage always on
(`bunfig.toml`: text + lcov). 149 tests across the five domains pass; CI uploads coverage to
Codecov from the Node 24 job. Tests sit beside the code and import from the domain's
`index.ts` (`from "."`).

This ADR records that practice as a rule and sets what a change's tests must cover.

## Decision

1. **Every change ships tests** for its happy path and its obvious failure paths. For this
   package that means, per affected export: English digits, Nepali digits, mixed digits,
   empty string, zero, negative, decimal, a large value (≥ 1 crore), invalid input, and the
   boundary specific to the function (99/100 for words, 4/5 for ordinals, 3/4 digits for
   commas). Part of being done, not a follow-up.
2. **A bug fix starts with a test that fails for the bug's reason.**
3. **A test must have been seen to fail** (written first, or checked by breaking the code)
   before it counts.
4. **Runner: `bun test`**, tests beside the code as `<domain>.test.ts`, importing from `"."`,
   typed with `@types/bun`. Coverage stays on.
5. **Language tables are tested by value.** A change to `src/constants.ts` asserts the exact
   strings it produces, so a spelling change is visible in the test diff.
6. **Tests assert exact strings** with `toBe`, never `toContain` or regex matches on output.
7. **The built package is smoke-tested**: CI packs the tarball, installs it and `require`s it.
   A change to the `exports` map or formats extends that smoke test to cover ESM `import`.
8. **Coverage target**: every function and every reachable line. Unreachable defensive
   fallbacks (today: three in `src/words/words.ts`) are acceptable and listed in the ADR that
   adds them.

## Options considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — `bun test`, built in, as today | No extra dependency; fast; already in use | Smaller ecosystem than Vitest | Chosen |
| B — Vitest | Rich ecosystem | Extra dependency for no gain here | Rejected |
| C — Tests optional for small changes | Faster small changes | A one-word table change is small and breaking | Rejected |

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Every output a consumer sees is pinned by a test.

**Negative / accepted trade-offs**

- Every change takes longer. Accepted.

**For consumers**

- Fewer silent output changes between releases.

## Package invariants

Guards §6.4 (no throwing for declared inputs) and §6.5 (output strings are the contract).

## Security considerations

Tests for input parsing include a long hostile string (ReDoS check, ADR-0005). Tests never
contain a real secret.

## Implementation notes

- [ ] `AGENTS.md` §3 and §5 describe the rule and commands — done with this ADR.
- Tests: the rule is already followed by the 149 existing tests.
