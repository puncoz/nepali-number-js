## Context

Contributors may have a library of installed skills (brainstorming, debugging, planning, TDD,
TypeScript, code review, release management…). Used, they make work consistent. But they are
written for generic projects, and several carry process opinions that contradict this
repository: a brainstorming skill that writes specs to its own folder and commits them, a
planning skill that proceeds straight to implementation, a release skill that bumps the version
and publishes, skills that add dependencies freely.

## Decision

1. **Use skills**: invoke any skill that fits, and name it. Process skills come before
   implementation skills.
2. **Precedence**: `AGENTS.md` and `docs/` are binding; skills are advisory; default behaviour
   comes last.
3. **No skill grants a permission this repository withholds**: code before approval, commits,
   tags, version bumps or publishing, new dependencies or tooling, a different docs layout,
   output changes without a semver decision, *what*-comments, language or security decisions,
   and tool behaviour asserted from recall.
4. **Skills stop at the gate**: a workflow that ends in "implement" ends here at
   `Status: Proposed`; one that ends in "commit" or "publish" ends at a proposed commit message.
5. **Report what was dropped**: when a rule cuts a skill short, say which skill, which step,
   and which rule.
6. **No skills are vendored** into the repository. Any installed skill may be used under this
   file. Vendoring a pinned set would be its own ADR.

## Options considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — Skills advisory, repo docs binding | Method from skills, authority from the repo | Agents must reconcile the two | Chosen |
| B — Skills binding | Simple | Skills would bypass the ADR gate, the commit rule and publishing | Rejected |
| C — No skills | No conflicts | Loses consistent method | Rejected |
| D — Vendor a pinned set of trusted skills | Reviewed, reproducible method | Maintenance cost out of proportion for a small library today | Deferred |

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Consistent method without giving up the gate.

**Negative / accepted trade-offs**

- Some skill steps are routinely dropped (spec folders, commits, publishing) and must be
  reported.

**For consumers**

- None.

## Package invariants

None directly.

## Security considerations

Prevents skills from adding dependencies, running install or publish commands, or making
security decisions on the owner's behalf.

## Implementation notes

- [ ] `AGENTS.md` §12 holds the precedence and the "no skill authorises" table.
- Tests: not applicable (process only).

## Docs to update on implementation

- [ ] `docs/adr/README.md` — status.
