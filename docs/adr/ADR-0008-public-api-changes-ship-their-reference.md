# ADR-0008 — A public API change ships its reference and a semver decision

- **Design documents:** `AGENTS.md` §2, §6, §8; `docs/api/`; `docs/release/versioning.md`;
  `docs/_templates/api.md`

## Context

The package's API is not only its signatures. Consumers render its **output strings** to
people and often compare them in their own tests. `toNepaliWords(21)` returning `"एक्काईस"` is
as much a part of the contract as the function's name.

Semver for a library like this is easy to get wrong in both directions: a "fix" to a spelling
breaks every consumer snapshot; a new optional option is a minor release even though nothing
existing changes. The release workflow derives the bump from commit prefixes, so the
classification has to be made deliberately, before the commit exists.

Reviewing an API change from code alone is also hard: the reviewer has to run it in their head.
Reviewing a page of real signatures and outputs is easy.

## Decision

1. **An ADR that changes anything a consumer can import or observe** ships the updated
   `docs/api/<domain>.md` in the same change, written from `docs/_templates/api.md`: the exact
   signature, every option and default, and example outputs for typical, Nepali-digit, zero,
   negative, decimal, ≥ 1 crore and invalid input. The two are reviewed together.
2. **Every ADR states its semver impact** in its header, following
   [`docs/release/versioning.md`](../release/versioning.md):
   - **major** — removing or renaming an export or option; changing a parameter, a default or a
     return type; **changing the output for any existing input**, except as in "patch";
     changing the published shape (`exports`, formats, global name, dropping a runtime).
   - **minor** — a new export, a new optional option, a new accepted input type, or newly
     handling input that previously returned the safe default.
   - **patch** — a fix that brings output in line with the documented behaviour in
     `docs/api/`, where the old output contradicted the reference; performance with identical
     output.
3. **Output changes carry a before/after table** in the ADR.
4. **The proposed commit message matches the impact** (`feat:`, `feat!:`, `fix:`, `perf:`).

## Options considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — Reference + semver decision with every API ADR; output changes are major unless they fix a documented contradiction | Reviewable; classification made before the commit; consumers protected | Some fixes to wrong-but-undocumented output wait for a major | Chosen |
| B — Treat all output corrections as patches | Faster fixes | Breaks consumer snapshots in patch releases | Rejected |
| C — Treat every output change as major | Simplest rule | Even fixing a documented bug needs a major | Rejected |

## Consequences

**Positive**

- API review happens on paper; the release bump is decided by the owner, not by habit.

**Negative / accepted trade-offs**

- Wrong-but-undocumented output (several entries in `docs/api/limitations.md`) can only change
  in a major, or once the owner decides the reference should have said otherwise. Accepted.

**For consumers**

- Patch and minor upgrades do not change existing output except to fix a documented bug.

## Package invariants

Implements §6.5 (output strings are the contract).

## Security considerations

None — this change adds no dependency, no regular expression and no CI or publishing change.

## Implementation notes

- [ ] `docs/api/` exists with a page per domain and `limitations.md`.
- [ ] `docs/release/versioning.md` states the policy above.
- [ ] `docs/_templates/api.md` exists.
- Tests: not applicable (process only).
