# ADR-0009 — Hold the package invariants: zero dependencies, environment-agnostic, pure, non-throwing

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-10-30
- **Deciders:** Puncoz Nepal
- **Approved by:** —

- **Supersedes:** —
- **Superseded by:** —
- **Semver impact:** none (records existing constraints)
- **Design documents:** `AGENTS.md` §6, `docs/architecture/system.md`

## Context

The previous `AGENTS.md` listed a set of non-negotiable constraints — zero runtime
dependencies, no environment-specific APIs, strict TypeScript, pure functions, no throwing,
explicit return types, Unicode safety. They were stated as rules but never recorded as a
decision, and some of them did not match the code:

- "Input normalisation via `normalize()` at the top of every function" — no function does this.
- "Importing a domain from another domain is a pitfall" — the code does it throughout
  (`words` imports `formatting` and `utils`; `currency` imports `formatting` and `words`;
  `utils` imports `formatting`), in one direction, with no cycles.
- "No throwing" — true for every value of the declared parameter types; `null` and
  `undefined`, which the types exclude, throw in `toNepali`, `toEnglish`,
  `formatNepaliNumber`, `normalize` and others.

This ADR records the invariants that actually hold, so they can be relied on and so departing
from one is a visible decision.

## Decision

The invariants in `AGENTS.md` §6 hold for every change:

1. **Zero runtime dependencies.** `dependencies` and `peerDependencies` stay empty.
2. **Environment-agnostic.** No host globals (`window`, `document`, `process`, `Buffer`, `fs`, …)
   in `src/`.
3. **Pure and stateless.** No module-level mutable state, no import side effects, no classes in
   the public API.
4. **No throwing for declared input types.** Invalid content returns a documented safe default.
   Values outside the declared types (`null`, `undefined`, objects) are not part of the contract;
   accepting them is a minor-version decision (ADR-0008).
5. **Output strings are the contract** (ADR-0008).
6. **Language data lives in `src/constants.ts`.**
7. **Unicode-aware string handling** — explicit `[०-९]` ranges, never `\d` for Nepali digits.
8. **Small and tree-shakeable** — named exports only, no default export.

And one structural rule: **domain dependencies point one way** —
`constants` ← `conversion` ← `formatting` ← `utils` ← `words` ← `currency` — with no cycles,
as drawn in [`docs/architecture/system.md`](../architecture/system.md).

## Options considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — Record the invariants that hold, and the actual layering | Rules match the code; departures are visible | Drops two rules the old file stated | Chosen |
| B — Keep the old rules and refactor the code to match | Stricter isolation between domains | Large refactor for no consumer benefit; `words` genuinely needs `formatting` | Rejected |
| C — No recorded invariants | No overhead | Agents re-derive or violate them | Rejected |

## Consequences

**Positive**

- An agent can rely on §6 being true of the current code.

**Negative / accepted trade-offs**

- Domains are not independently extractable. Accepted: they ship as one small bundle.

**For consumers**

- None; this records the current behaviour.

## Package invariants

This ADR defines them.

## Security considerations

Zero runtime dependencies and no host globals are the package's main supply-chain and
capability controls (ADR-0005).

## Implementation notes

- [ ] `AGENTS.md` §6 lists the invariants; §5 the layering.
- [ ] `docs/architecture/system.md` draws the layering.
- Tests: not applicable (records existing constraints).

## Docs to update on implementation

- [ ] `docs/adr/README.md` — status.
