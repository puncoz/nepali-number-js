# ADR-0003 — Comments explain why; every export has TSDoc; every branch takes a block

- **Design documents:** `AGENTS.md` §7

## Context

AI-written code tends to over-comment: restating the code, adding banners and section headers.
Those comments rot as the code changes, and they hide the few that matter — which in this
domain are many: why ordinals 1–4 are irregular, why `\d` cannot be used on Nepali input, why a
value is floored rather than rounded, a floating-point edge.

At the same time this is a library. Its TSDoc is emitted into `dist/nepali-number.d.ts` and is
what consumers read in their editor on hover. Today `conversion` and `formatting` have TSDoc;
most of `words`, `currency` and `utils` do not.

Separately, an unbraced `if` body reads as guarded when a second line is added under it, and
the diff looks right. The existing code braces every branch; nothing enforces it, because no
linter is installed.

## Decision

1. **Comments explain *why*; the code explains *what*.** Default to no comment. Write one only
   for reasoning, trade-offs, edge cases or external constraints that cannot be recovered from
   the code. Prefer a reference to an ADR over prose. One or two lines, directly above what they
   explain. No banners, no `=====` headers.
2. **Every export carries TSDoc**: summary, `@param` for each parameter, `@returns` including
   the safe default for invalid input, and at least one `@example` with real output. Missing
   TSDoc is added when an export is next touched.
3. **Configuration files may describe what a key does** (`tsconfig.json`, `tsdown.config.ts`,
   `bunfig.toml`, CI workflows), still briefly, still linking the governing ADR.
4. **Tooling-consumed comments stay**: TSDoc, `@ts-expect-error` reasons, pragmas.
5. **Every control-flow branch takes a block**: `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `do` bodies are
   braced even for one statement. Enforced in review until a linter is adopted; the ADR that
   adopts one turns on `curly: ["error", "all"]`.
6. **Existing comments are not rewritten for their own sake**; they are brought in line when
   the code around them changes.

## Options considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — Why-only comments + mandatory TSDoc on exports + braces | Comments stay meaningful; consumers get editor docs | Requires discipline; braces unenforced until a linter arrives | Chosen |
| B — Comment liberally | Feels explanatory | Comments rot and drown the important ones | Rejected |
| C — Adopt ESLint now to enforce braces | Mechanical enforcement | A new dev dependency and config; deserves its own ADR | Deferred |

## Consequences

**Positive**

- The comments that exist are worth reading; consumers get documentation on hover.

**Negative / accepted trade-offs**

- The brace rule relies on review until a linter exists.

**For consumers**

- Better editor documentation as exports are touched.

## Package invariants

None directly.

## Security considerations

None — this change adds no dependency, no regular expression and no CI or publishing change.
Comments must still never contain secrets (ADR-0005).

## Implementation notes

- [ ] `AGENTS.md` §7 states the policy.
- Tests: not applicable (process only).
