# ADR-0004 — Resolve ambiguity by asking, never by guessing

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-10-30

- **Semver impact:** none (process only)
- **Design documents:** `AGENTS.md` §4

## Context

The cheapest failure for an agent is to pick something plausible and move on. The assumption
looks finished, gives no signal it was made, and is found late — in a published package, by
consumers.

Much of this package is **language data and conventions** that cannot be derived from code or
looked up reliably by an agent: Nepali number words have regional and standard spellings
(`दश` / `दस`, `एक्काईस` / `एक्काइस`), ordinals have irregular forms, scales above अर्ब have
competing names, and there are choices about how a negative amount or a rounded paisa should
read. An agent asked to "fix" one of these will produce something that looks right to anyone
who cannot read Nepali.

## Decision

1. **Classify the question first.**
   - *Verifiable* (what the code returns, TypeScript, tsdown or Bun behaviour, what the build
     emits, what a config sets): **check it** — run it, read the source or `node_modules/`.
     Don't assert from memory and don't ask the owner.
   - *Undetermined* (Nepali spelling or grammar, word forms, rounding and sign conventions,
     output format, API naming, semver classification, supported runtimes, scope): **ask**.
2. **Every question carries** the decision in one line and why it can't be settled from the
   code; two to four concrete options with their consequences — for language questions, the
   exact output string each option produces; a recommendation listed first and marked; and what
   each option builds, costs and forecloses, including whether it breaks consumers. Use a
   selectable options tool where available.
3. **No silent assumptions.** Work that proceeds on an assumption states it in the response and
   in the ADR or document it shapes.
4. **Ask at ADR time**, in *Options considered*. Mid-implementation: finish what doesn't depend
   on the answer, then ask.

## Options considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — Ask with options + recommendation; check what is checkable | Owner answers by picking; language decisions recorded; no noise for verifiable facts | Some interruptions | Chosen |
| B — Agent decides and documents | Fewer interruptions | Wrong Nepali looks like right Nepali to most reviewers | Rejected |
| C — Ask everything open-ended | Maximum control | Slow; the owner has to write the specification | Rejected |

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Language and API decisions stay with the owner and are written down.

**Negative / accepted trade-offs**

- More questions at ADR time. Accepted: that is the cheapest moment for them.

**For consumers**

- Output strings change only when someone who can judge them has decided.

## Package invariants

Protects §6.5 (output strings are the contract) and §6.6 (language data has one home).

## Security considerations

Dependency, CI-token and publishing questions are always *undetermined* and always asked
(ADR-0005).

## Implementation notes

- [ ] `AGENTS.md` §4 states the rule.
- Tests: not applicable (process only).

## Docs to update on implementation
